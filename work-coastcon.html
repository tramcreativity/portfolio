        <h1>CoastCon Virtuality</h1>
        <p>IAAPA is well-known in the thrill ride industry for its annual trade show which showcases new thrill rides
            available to theme parks around the world. However, the industry underwent significant changes in attendance
            and handling of events due to the global pandemic of 2019-2020. To adapt to this unprecedented situation,
            IAAPA has launched a new virtual event called CoastCon. This virtual event is designed to showcase exciting
            new products and experiences that are available in the industry, while also providing opportunities for
            networking and collaboration.
            <br>
            <br>
            I worked with two other classmates, Alexus Jenkins, and Sarah Kouch, on this project. Even though the
            project was originally intended for a larger group, the three of us took on the challenge with enthusiasm
            and determination. With a tight deadline and a long list of deliverables, we divided the work evenly and
            collaborated closely to ensure that every aspect of the project was executed to the highest standard. My
            particular focus was on designing the brand identity package and physical products, as well as creating an
            intuitive and seamless ticket purchase experience for attendees. I also designed the speakers’ and
            attendees’ profile pages, ensuring that it was user-friendly and functional. It was a challenging but
            incredibly rewarding experience that taught us the value of collaboration, time management, and creative
            problem-solving.
